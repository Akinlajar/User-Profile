        <h2>MY BEST FOOD</h2>

        <p>Rice and Stew and beans is a popular and versatile dish enjoyed in many parts of the world,
            especially in Africa. It consists of plain boiled rice served with a flavorful tomato-based stew,
            often enriched with spices, vegetables, and proteins such as chicken, beef, or fish.
            The combination of tender rice and richly seasoned stew makes it a comfort food loved by many.
